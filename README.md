# Plants-vs-Ants
Repository for final project of APCS. We are doing a Plant VS Zombies-esque game.

### **Group Name:**  The Peashooters
### **Group Members:** Ivan Yeung, Joshua Liu

### **Google Doc Prototype:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhDlcYSymbh_knjGXvz3SfxvtfaYGgMqSy5-5mDk_x8/edit?usp=sharing

## **Brief Description**
The project that we will be working on is a Plants vs. Zombies-esque game. Instead of having zombies, they will be ants but their mechanics will be around the same. This project will consist of making various plant classes, ant classes, and tile classes. There will be a grid of 9 by 5 tiles. Each tile can hold one plant and these plants will stop the incoming enemies from reaching the other side of the grid by shooting at them. Placing plants will require energy(sunlight) that drops onto the map or produced by a plant. There will be a variety of plants and ants with their own unique traits.
